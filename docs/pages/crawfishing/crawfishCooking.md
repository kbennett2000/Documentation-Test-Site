## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Clean the Crawfish
1. Fill a bucket with crawfish and fresh water (no salt needed).  
2. Rinse **2–3 times**, stirring to remove dirt and mud.  
3. Discard dead crawfish and trash.  
4. Repeat with fresh water until it’s **crystal clear** (~4–5 rinses).

---

### Step 2: Prepare the Pot & Initial Seasoning
1. Fill pot with water to **3–4 holes**.  
   > *Tip:* Less water = less seasoning needed.  
2. Bring to a **full boil** over high heat.  
3. Add **½ bag of seasoning** + **5 lemon halves** (squeeze or toss in whole).  
4. Wait until the aroma is strong—your neighbors should be jealous.

### Step 3: Boil the Fixings
1. Add **potatoes, onions, and garlic**.  
2. Once at a **rolling boil**, cook **10 minutes**.  
3. Check tenderness; when nearly done, add **sausage and hot dogs**.  
4. Remove all fixings and set aside.

---

### Step 4: Recharge the Boil
1. Add **remaining ½ bag of seasoning** + **remaining lemon halves**.  
2. Return to a **rolling boil**.

---

### Step 5: Boil the Crawfish
1. Dump in the cleaned crawfish.  
2. Wait for the water to return to a **rolling boil**.  
3. Boil for **5 minutes**.  
   > *Note:* Early-season soft-shell crawfish cook fast—adjust if needed.

---

### Step 6: Soak & Finish
1. Add **frozen corn** (cools the water and stops cooking).  
2. Let **soak for 20 minutes**.  
3. Test doneness: twist a crawfish head—it should pop off easily.
